## Details

This project was made for the Junior Year Robotics Competition (JYRC) 2022 held in Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI). The competition rules are explained [here](https://github.com/Attaulhaleem/Arduino-Maze/blob/main/doc/JYRC 2022.pdf).

Ragnar is the robot which maps the maze and transmits data to Flokki via Bluetooth.

Flokki is the robot which receives the data, calculates, and traverses the shortest path.
