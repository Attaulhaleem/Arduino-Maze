# aMaze
Mapping and solving of closed mazes using the Arduino platform.

This project was made for the Junior Year Robotics Competition (JYRC) 2022 held in GIKI.

Competition rules are explained in the JYRC statement.

Ragnar is the robot which maps the maze and transmits data to Flokki.

Flokki receives the data, calculates, and traverses the shortest path.
